# UPM-Kanto-JP

This repository shares the relevant data and codes used in Chakraborty and Kotha (2025) for generating the regional site response maps of the Kanto region of Japan. 

# Description of Folders: 

Data_Site-Response: ΔS2S and ΔWs site-response data of the 60 Kik-net sites

Ordinary Kriging Codes: R scripts for Ordinary Kriging (global neighborhood) at T=1s, 0.1s, and 0.01s. 

UPM Codes: WinBUGS scripts for UPM at T=1s, 0.1s, and 0.01s.
